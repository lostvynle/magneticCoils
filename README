This module was developed to calculate the field primarily for Helmholtz 
and Anti-Helmholtz coil configurations used in cold atom experiments.

It is designed for circular windings of wires who's diameter is small compared to the coil diameter.
it assumes all the current is in the center of each winding.  It is pretty accurate under these conditions:
Suitable for most cold atom experiments.

The CoilArray class assuming uniform separation between windings in each direction (dr axial, and dR radial)
